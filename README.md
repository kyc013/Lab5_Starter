1) Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application. Unit tests are used to test individual components or functions in isolation to ensure they are working correctly. In this case, testing the "message" feature would involve verifying that a user can write and send a message successfully, check if the message is received by the intended recipient, and validate any other related functionality.

2) Yes, I would also use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application. Unit tests are useful for testing specific functionality, such as input validation or character limits. In this case, the unit test would check if the application properly enforces the limit of 80 characters for a message, and verify that the user is unable to type more than the allowed length. This ensures that the feature works as intended and prevents any potential issues with long messages.
